       Yoshi Color
 
 Programme écrit en langage C permettant de calculer les coordonnées Lab d'une couleur
 à partir du spectre de transmission de l'échantillon.
 
 Les données d'entrées doivent se présenter sous forme de colones :
 - 1er colone : longueurs d'onde 
 - colones suivantes : données en transmission (entre 0 et 1)
 
 les spectres doivent couvrir la gamme 380 - 780 nm / 5nm.
 
 le programme calcul les coordinnées Lab avec pour illuminant D65 et observer CIE 1931 2°;
 
 
 2012 - Myrtille Hunault
 
 ********
 Upgrade - 2014 - Myrtille Hunault
 
 - added the sample name in the output files
 - removed the plotting in the main
 - add a 4th argument in write_Lab as the number of samples form the value "Ech" of the main
 - duplicate the write_Lab into write_wyz function to definite columns names in each output file
